## Related Dataset
_In-vivo rat 14_ dataset is available in <em>Zenodo</em>. Patients imaging data are not available due to ethical, medical and legislative considerations towards personal information. 

## Folder's organization
* `/Example script`

  This folder contains an example script of sULM and all functions called in the <em>Akebia</em> software. The script generates 3 composite images, i.e. slow and rapid tracking are superimposed: 

  * Image density based on microbubbles counts: pixel intensity codes the number of microbubbles crossing this pixel

  * Image density with axial color encoding: pixel intensity codes the number of microbubbles crossing upward/downward

  * Velocity magnitude image: pixel intensity represents the average bubble velocity in _mm/s_

  More details in the `README` inside this folder.

* `/Software_Akebia`

  This folder contains the open platform <em>Akebia</em>. It is a standalone application and there's no need to own Matlab to install this software. More details in the `README` and the `User Guide` inside this folder.

* `/Results`

  Example of images generated by the example script `Akebia_example_script.m` or by the <em>Akebia</em> software after processing the _In-vivo rat 14_ dataset : blocks 10 to 20 and 27 to 32 of 800 frames each.

  `Density.tif`, `Directivity.tif` and `Velocity.tif` are presented here. But you can also find `HumanDensity.tif`, `HumanDirectivity.tif` and `HumanVelocity.tif` of patient number 1 (same as in the article). More details in the `README` inside `/Example script` and `/Software Akebia`.
